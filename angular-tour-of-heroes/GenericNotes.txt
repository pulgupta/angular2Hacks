Template Reference Variable : Template Reference Variable provides direct access to an element
from within the template. 
    <input #box (keyup)="0">
    <p>{{box.value}}</p>

    ^^ The box here refers to the input element and then we can use that to display the value.
    Each template reference variable is prefixed by a #.



In a model class when using forms we can use public ego?: string ->> a question mark to show that 
this value is an optional field in the form. This was inside a constructor so basicly we can 
create an object of this model class without passing the optional field.
